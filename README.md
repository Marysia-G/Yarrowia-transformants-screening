# Yarrowia-transformants-screening
Scripts to analyze and select transformation subclones of Yarrowia lipolytica with the most abundant phenotype for further analysis.
1) with no recombinant protein - read only growth
2) with fluorescent protein - read growth and fluorescence, calculate specific fluorescence (fluorescence devided by biomass accumulation - growth)
3) with amylolytic protein - read growth and enzymatic activity, calculate specific activity
